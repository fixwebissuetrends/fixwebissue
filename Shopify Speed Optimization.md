Why Shopify Speed Optimization Matters
Page speed plays a major role in both user experience and search engine rankings. Even a one-second delay can lead to higher bounce rates and lower sales.
Key benefits of speed optimization:
•	Faster page load times
•	Higher conversion rates
•	Improved Google rankings

•	Reduced cart abandonment

Comprehensive Shopify Store Speed Audit
The optimization process begins with a detailed performance audit. This identifies bottlenecks affecting your store’s speed.
Audit includes:

•	Theme and code evaluation
•	App performance review
•	Image and media assessment
•	Mobile vs desktop performance comparison

Theme Code Streamlining
